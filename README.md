# CIT225 NBA-database final project

Samuel Kaleopa
#Project Details
- The goal of this project is to gain experience with database design and implementation. You need to choose a small domain (for example, food carts or campus sports teams) for which to implement a database, along with populating it with real data and producing example queries to execute over it.

- For tables csv, those files can insert data easily on MySQL tables using Data import...
- NBA database export - that is my whole nba database creation...
- ERD and Forward engineering - that's containg my ERD forward engineering code...
